# Step 1.4 - Introduction to React (Demo)

In this demo we'll be creating a simple counter that will display a count and increment on click.

Let's start this demo in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/micahgodbolt/pen/wOWeVb?editors=0010).

## React Hello World

```js
ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello World</p>, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Calling `ReactDOM.render()` is how our code gets on the page. The function takes two parameters: the content to place on the page, and the element in which you want it placed.

The first parameter to `render()` looks a lot like HTML, but actually, it's [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). There are a few key differences between JSX and HTML:

- Since `class` is a [reserved word](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords) in JavaScript, you will need to use `className` on your HTML tags: `<div className="foo">`
- We can use custom HTML tags corresponding to the React components we create: `<div><MyControl>hi</MyControl></div>`
- Controls can be self-closing: `<MyControl text='hi' />`
- You can use JavaScript inside of JSX!

## Writing a React component

A React component is a function that returns a portion of your application. This can include HTML markup, CSS styles, and JavaScript driven functionality.

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  return <p>Hello World</p>;
};
```

Moving our "Hello World" markup into our App's `render` function, we can now update the `ReactDOM.render()` call to look like this:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

### Props

A component can take in additional props using the same syntax as HTML attributes like `id` or `href`.

```jsx
<App text="Hello World" />
```

The `text` prop can be accessed inside your component via `props.text` in a component.

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.text}</p>;
};
```

`props` allow your component to be more reusable, since you can create multiple instances of the same component with different props.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <App text="Hello World" />
    <App text="How are you doing?" />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

> Note that a render function can only return a single element, so our two `App` components need to be wrapped in a `div`.

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.text ? props.text : 'oops!'}</p>;
};
```

### Destructuring props

Writing `props.text` over and over in a function can be quite tedious. Since this is all JavaScript, you could create a new variable for this text using variable assignment.

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  const text = props.text;
  return <p>{text ? text : 'you missed something'}</p>;
};
```

This works fine for a single prop, but as your component starts to become more complex:

```jsx
<App
  open={false}
  count={5}
  text="Hello World"
  items={['cat', 'dog', 'bird']}
  config={{
    start: 1,
    end: 10,
    autoStart: true,
  }}
/>
```

> Note that all non-string values are passed through as JavaScript by wrapping them in `{}`.

Your code starts to look like this:

```jsx
const open = props.open;
const text = props.text;
const count = props.count;
const items = props.items;
```

A common approach to simplify this process is to use a syntax called [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring).

Destructuring allows you to pull individual pieces of information out of an object in a single statement.

```jsx
const { open, text, count, items } = props;
```

So while this might be overkill right now, it makes it easier to add props down the road.

### Cleanup

Before we move on, we'll modify our `ReactDOM.render` call to just include our App. This render call typically includes just a single component with no props.

Next we'll be creating a `Counter` component. We'll add that to our App now, and then start to write the control.

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  return <Counter text="chickens" />;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

> Note the capitalization of `Counter`. HTML might not be case-sensitive, but JSX is! A common practice is to use the capitalized names of HTML elements to name corresponding React components: Button, Select, Label, Form, etc.

## Writing a stateful Counter component

The power of React, past being a good templating language, is that it provides us a way to maintain and modify state over the componet's lifecycle.

### Adding state

State is added to a component by using the `useState` hook. [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are special React methods that can only be called within a React component, and provide ways to maintain state and perform other lifecycle methods.

```js
const Counter = (props) => {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = React.useState(0);
};
```

- The component takes in some`props`.
- `clicks` is a stateful value that will be updated each time `setClicks` is called with a new value

### Rendering our Counter

For our `Counter` component, the goal is to be able to track how many times the counter's button is clicked. We'll use the following markup.

```jsx
const { text } = props;
return (
  <div>
    {text}: {clicks}
    <button>Click</button>
  </div>
);
```

### Writing our button click handler

Our next step is to wire up the button to increment the `clicks` in our component state.

This function will increment the clicks value by 1.

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  setClicks(clicks + 1);
};
```

Now that we have a function to increment our count, all that's left is to connect it to our button.

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
```

> Also note that each `Counter` maintains its own state! You can modify the state inside of one counter without affecting the others.

## Try it all out!

Add a couple `Counter`s to our `App`, each with different text. Notice how they can easy take in different props and maintain their own state.

## Moving this into our codebase

To scale our application, we'll need to break up the file into smaller, reusable pieces. In this part of the demo we'll look at the `final` folder and how the JavaScript module system allows us to break up our components into a collection of files exporting their functionality.

### Module exports and imports

Open up `step1-04/final/components/Counter.tsx` and look at the `Counter` component.

```tsx
export const Counter = (props) => {
  // ...
};
```

This file exports the Counter component as a **named export**. This means when we import it we do the following:

```tsx
import { Counter } from './components/Counter';
```

> Note the `{}` wrapped around the import value. This is actually an example of destructuring.

#### Default exports

We typically use named exports, but it's also possible export a default value like this:

```tsx
export default const Counter = (props) =>{
  // ...
}
```

When we import the component we can call it whatever we want:

```tsx
import SomeCounterComponent from './components/Counter';
```

## Writing a Button component

Buttons are among the most commonly written components. Custom buttons help abstract common styling, add icons or other decorations, and increase functionality (menu buttons etc). Let's take a quick look at a custom button component to see how it comes together.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './Button.css';

export const Button = (props) => {
  return (
    <button className="Button" onClick={props.onClick}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
};
```
